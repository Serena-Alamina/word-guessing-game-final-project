Summary:
- Added an option to choose between 1-4 players at the beginning of the program
- Added the feature of taking turns after guessing a letter in the word
- Added indicators of how many times a letter occurs in the word and how many attempts a player still has
Needed fixes:
- Removal of the underscores indicating the placement of the letter in the word
- Need to add a word guess after guessing a letter
- Need to display the final score after the game is finished
- Need to add a way to indicate to players what the theme of the word bank is
